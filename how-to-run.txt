Method 1 (Recommended, using virtual environment)
********


1. Creating an Virtual Environment(to avoid unnecessary issues)

    (a)open VScode terminal, or any other terminal and run this to create an Virtual Environment:
       
       "python -m venv myenv"

    (b) Then activate the Virtual Environment:
        
       Windows:-  "myenv\Scripts\activate", on command prompt terminal
       MacOs and Linux:-  "source myenv/bin/activate"

2. Now, Unzip the chatbot.zip file into the folder containing myenv folder

    It should resemble this 
     folder
     - myenv
     - chatbot
    
3. Now, move into the chatbot folder on the terminal
   
   cd chatbot

   (a) Install the dependencies:- Open the terminal, and write 
     
       "pip install -r requirements.txt"

4. Now, on the same terminal directory, run
  
   "python app.py"

   make sure the Virtual Environment is activate on that terminal


You are all set, just follow the mentioned link and use the chatbot 





********
Method 2 (Not using the virtual environment)
********


Unzip the folder and open it in code editor

1. Install the dependencies:- Open the terminal, and write 
     
       "pip install -r requirements.txt"

2. Now, on the same terminal directory, run
  
   "python app.py"


You are all set, just follow the mentioned link and use the chatbot 




*************
Alternatively,(in all methods)
*************

You can run the chatbot by itself, uncommenting the last 4 lines of the chatbot.py file and running it.

"python chatbot.py"

Make sure to comment them like before to use the web app again, and also be sure you are into the chatbot directory on the terminal
